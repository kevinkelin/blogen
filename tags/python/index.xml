      <title>In python, how to achieve the effect of abstract class?</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/interface-in-python.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that there is the concept of interface in java. A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it must implement all the methods in the interface, but there is no concept of interface in python. Classes can inherit through multiple inheritance Since there are multiple classes, now if we want to implement the effect of the interface in java, it is mandatory that the subclass must implement some methods, how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When looking at the sanic source code, I found that when defining a class, a &lt;code&gt;__slots__&lt;/code&gt; attribute will be set. Since I have not used a magic variable before, I checked it and record the function of this attribute here.
We know that in a python instance, we can dynamically bind attributes and methods to the instance, like the following&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixin is nothing new in python, it is just a manifestation of programming ideas, using its multi-inheritance language features to achieve a flexible programming method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was looking at the source code of sanic and found that there are many Mixin classes, which probably look like this&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I want to see how much difference there is in the performance of go and python. I don’t know, but the gap is still quite large. In order to facilitate the experiment, both background services access the same redis server. Simply use the get command to get a value, Then return it in json format&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The solution to the too many connections error reported in redis</title>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/redis-too-many-connections.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, when I stress tested an interface in the system, I found that there was a large number of errors reported in the redis query interface, so I checked the background log and found that aioredis reported &lt;code&gt;Too many connections&lt;/code&gt;. At first, I thought it was because of the stress test. , because this interface needs to access redis data, and a large number of requests come in at the same time, it will cause a large number of requests to the redis server, and the redis server can&amp;rsquo;t resist returning the &lt;code&gt;Too many connections&lt;/code&gt; error, but this is not the case after investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I used the framework &lt;strong&gt;sanic&lt;/strong&gt;, which is known as the most powerful performance among python web frameworks, to build the basic environment and project framework of the project, but I have made a choice syndrome when using ORM. For a framework that pursues performance, After using ORM, it will definitely have some impact on performance, but how big is the impact? The existence of ORM also has its reasons, so can its advantages eliminate its performance loss?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/use-socketio-in-tornado.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the project I am working on recently, I need to send the video stream or audio stream from the mobile phone to the server, and then the server will forward it to the browser. At first, I used redis as a relay to send the data to redis, and then the redis server Publish and subscribe function, the overall structure is as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://yyxbloguse.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210519225715299.png&#34; alt=&#34;image-20210519225715299&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It mainly uses the pub/sub function of redis. There is no problem with this solution, but the overall performance bottleneck is affected by redis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came into contact with socketio and found that this requirement can be achieved by using it, but I found some information on the Internet. In the use of python, it is mainly flask-socketio and native applications. Since the current project uses Tornado to build, I use it. Fusion of socketio and Tornado for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will be introduced in several parts, mainly the following chapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to socketio and the construction of scaffolding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define message processing events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message release and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use socketio in front-end vue to communicate with back-end&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/python-aiomysql.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using tornado for projects before, and the database has been mostly using mongo and redis. With its excellent asynchronous features, it works very stably and efficiently. The recent project needs to use mysql, because moto and aioredis are used when using mongo and redis before. The database operation is performed asynchronously, so the database of asynchronous operation mysql is queried on the Internet. This article records the problems encountered in asynchronous operation and the corresponding solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common way to use logs in python is to output logs in the console and files. The logging module also provides the corresponding classes very well, which is very convenient to use, but sometimes we may have some requirements, such as Send the log to the remote, or write directly to the database, how to achieve this requirement?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often see some code using &lt;code&gt;functools.partial&lt;/code&gt; to wrap a function. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about its usage before, but I just wrote it according to other people&amp;rsquo;s code. I took a closer look at its usage today. The basic usage is still very simple. .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When writing a system, we have to consider the accuracy of writing to the database at high concurrency. Take mongodb as an example, for example, to insert a piece of data, update if it exists, insert new data if it does not exist, and what will happen if there are multiple threads? The problem?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, when using log processing in python, there is a new requirement to write the log into the database. It is lazy at first, write a loop, read the local log file regularly, and write the content directly to the database. Obviously, this kind of processing is very low. Later, I wrote a service outside, but in essence, the read content is sent to a post request in a circular reading method and then stored in the database. These two methods are essentially the same, and The second one also encountered the problem of too much content causing service parsing failure when sending post requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the process of python development, we have always advocated the use of virtual environments for project isolation, so that various problems will not be caused due to different python packages. It&amp;rsquo;s actually very bad, and recently I have begun to try to use virtual environments to develop projects in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was looking at the source code of aiohttp and found a way of defining a function that I have never seen before. &lt;code&gt;def __enter__(self) -&amp;gt; None&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which made a person who has been hurt by C pointers come to Said that the whole person is not good, so I checked the usage of this arrow with an arrow.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using mongo and redis before, and I have recently started using the mysql database in the project.

      <title>Solve the problem that the mysql server actively disconnects after no operation timeout</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/connect_short_problem.html</link>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/connect_short_problem.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we use the mysql service, under normal circumstances, the timeout set by mysql is 8 hours (28800 seconds), that is to say, if a connection does not operate for 8 hours, then mysql will actively disconnect the connection. When this connection tries to query again, it will report a &amp;ldquo;MySQL server has gone away&amp;rdquo; error, but sometimes, due to some settings made by the mysql server, in many cases, the connection timeout will be shortened to ensure more connections. available. Sometimes the settings are abnormal, very short, 30 seconds, so that the client side needs to do some operations to ensure that mysql does not take the initiative to disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/use_filter_in_python_logging.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The thing is like this, I wrote a tornado service. During the process, I used logging to record some content. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t carefully observe tornado&amp;rsquo;s own log management at the beginning, I generally used debug to record ordinary logs, and there was a problem with error recording. , but when the service starts, it is found that the level of tornado&amp;rsquo;s access log is info, which is 20, and the level of debug is 10, so if I define the level of the log to be debug, it will definitely output to in the log file.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t care about access logs now, and since my service may have access all the time, it will have a great impact when I search for log information.
what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/aggregate-perday-mongodb.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I encountered a problem when writing a project. I used mongodb to record the execution results of the use cases, but the date format was used for the time records. Now there is a requirement to count the successful use cases and failures every day in days. When it comes to statistics, aggregate queries must be used, but if the time in date format is used as the group basis, it is equivalent to no grouping, because it is almost impossible to record the time of the use case at the same time. I checked the relevant documents today, You can use mongodb&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;$dateToString&lt;/code&gt; command to accomplish this requirement&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/a&gt; introduced the basic use of asyncio in python3, which can be used in actual work, due to the previous I have written too many multi-threading and multi-process, so for the previous writing style and some library functions that do not have asynchronous support, because they have to be written in asynchronous, there are still many synchronous methods for writing code. Today Here is a summary of how to deal with synchronous functions in asynchronous operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using multi-process and multi-threading in python can achieve running multiple tasks at the same time, and in the selection of multi-process and multi-threading, the multi-process method should be preferred, because multi-process is more stable, and the operation management of processes is also better. It is convenient, but one thing is the unique killer of multi-process. Multi-process can divide the process to run on multiple machines. If there are many tasks, even if a machine has multi-process or multi-process running, it will still consume a lot of money. Time, then think about whether the task can be distributed to multiple machines to run, so that the task can be completed faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When using the mongo database, simple queries can basically meet most business scenarios, but just imagine, how to query if you want to count how many times a recommendation appears in the specified data? The stupid way is to use &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to query the data, and then use the &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt; method for data statistics. This scenario is fine, but what if the sum of one of the fields is required? Is it necessary to traverse the corresponding data and then perform the sum operation?
In mysql we often use &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;group by&lt;/code&gt; and other queries, and in mongodb we can also use aggregation queries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If it is a pain to deal with character encoding in python2, and if you imagine that python3 is not so painful, then I just want to say that you think too much, and you have finally figured out the problem of character encoding in python2, but replace it with python3, it will rebuild the previous system, so that the previous knowledge system cannot be used well and can only be rebuilt. It feels like jumping from one pit to another pit. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this troublesome python coding problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using priority queues in python</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/priorityqueue_in_python.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/priorityqueue_in_python.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that everyone is familiar with the concept of queues. This first-in-first-out data structure is widely used, and queues are used in general production and consumption. For the introduction of queue usage, please refer to my previous article [Queue and Queue in Python] Multiprocessing (multiprocessing)](
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yangyanxing.com/article/1103.html&#34; title=&#34;https://www.yangyanxing.com/article/1103.html&#34; rel=&#34;noopener external nofollow noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34; exturl&#34;&gt;
    https://www.yangyanxing.com/article/1103.html
    &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;) There is also a stack, which is a first-in, last-out data structure. The surface priority queue is different from ordinary queues and stacks. In terms of implementation, it generally passes the data structure of the heap, and the heap is actually a complete binary tree. It sorts the elements entering the container (according to the rules specified in advance), and the order of dequeuing will be the root of the binary tree. The element represented by the dot. Next, we introduce the implementation of several priority queues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Encrypt password with salted hash function in python</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/python_generate_password_hash.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/python_generate_password_hash.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The development of a website is inseparable from the user&amp;rsquo;s registration and login. Today, we will talk about how to save user passwords during website development. The traditional methods are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plaintext storage: It can be recognized by the naked eye without any security. Who uses who is stupid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted storage: Through a certain transformation, the original password is not easy to be identified. There are several types of password encryption:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintext transcoding encryption: BASE64, 7BIT, etc. This method is just a trick, not real encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetric algorithm encryption: DES, RSA, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signature algorithm encryption: It can also be understood as one-way hash encryption, such as MD5, SHA1, etc. The encryption algorithm is fixed and easily cracked by brute force. If the passwords are the same, the resulting hash value is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salted hash encryption: A &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; string (salt value) is mixed in during encryption and then hashed and encrypted. Even if the password is the same, if the salt value is different, then the hash value is not the same. This encryption method is mainly used in website development now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article mainly introduces the fourth &amp;ldquo;salted hash encryption&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent projects, tornado is used in python3, and it has been used before. It is in python2. Since the understanding of coroutines is not very thorough, I just apply the writing in the official documents. Recently, I have looked at the usage of coroutines in detail, and also Practice tornado asynchronously in python3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuples and lists, everyone who writes python knows and knows that tuples are immutable, but is it necessary to create a new data type just because one is immutable?
The answer is definitely not, so let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how tuples are used&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The use of map, lambda, higher-order functions and decorators in python</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/higher-order-function.html</link>

      <guid>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/higher-order-function.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When friends with a little python foundation see some functions written by someone, they will intentionally write some higher-order functions, either with a map, or a lambda, and a higher @ decoration There is nothing difficult about the other things. The usage is more advanced. If you can follow its logic and use it in practical applications accurately, it will still bring a certain improvement in the efficiency of the program. As for readability, when When you are accustomed to these usages, you will feel that its readability is also very good. The reason why you are not used to it is mainly because you do not understand its usage. When it comes to readability, this is another topic, which will be discussed in detail later. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the use of higher-order functions and decorators today. I hope that friends who read this article have benefited from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sorted method passes in a list and returns a new list, which does not affect the order of the original list. From the above results, the numbers are sorted before the strings. In fact, they are sorted according to the ASCII order of the characters. If What about strings in the list?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In daily work, queues are often used. There are native queues in python, but since the native queues exist in memory, when the system restarts, there are no messages in the queues, and the step-by-step process cannot be performed. , List data in Redis has four primitives, LPUSH, LPOP, RPUSH, RPOP, which can be used together to achieve a simple production and consumption model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent project, there is a requirement to perform compatibility tests on applications on at least 100 mobile phones. The first thing that comes to mind is to automate the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic requirements are as follows, install the application under test, start and exit, and then install the test sample to detect whether there is a corresponding pop-up window interception&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the various test frameworks on the market and the programming languages ​​that I am familiar with, I finally chose Google&amp;rsquo;s own uiautomator to do it. With the help of predecessors, it was encapsulated in python, so it was very smooth at the beginning, but the whole process was still There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be aware of&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Queue and multiprocessing in python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came into contact with a project and wanted to run tasks in multiple virtual machines. With reference to the code of other people’s previous projects, multi-process was used to handle it, so I checked the multi-process in python on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Queue (queue object)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queue is the standard library in python, which can be directly imported and referenced. When I was studying before, I heard the famous &amp;ldquo;eat first, pull first&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;eat first, then spit&amp;rdquo;. In fact, it is the queue mentioned here. It can be defined when the queue is constructed. Its capacity, don&amp;rsquo;t eat it, if you eat too much, it will report an error, if you don&amp;rsquo;t write or write a number less than 1 when constructing, it means infinite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put a value into the queue (put)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;q&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;put(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;yang&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the requests library is powerful, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it yet. I touched it today and found that using urllib, urllib2 and other methods before is really too rubbish&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese encoding problem in python</title>
      <link>https://enblog.yangyanxing.com/article/1050.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of programming, the problem of Chinese coding has always been a headache. Today, I will write a summary of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion between unicode and utf-8 and gbk, the functions involved are decode and encode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is clear that strings in python are stored in a certain encoding. In Chinese, in gbk and utf-8, although you can define a variable s = u&amp;rsquo;Yang Yanxing&amp;rsquo;, you can Use type(s) to see its type. At this time, this s is not a string, but a unicode type. When you define s = &amp;lsquo;Yang Yanxing&amp;rsquo;, then type(s) is the str type, but when When you define s = &amp;lsquo;Yang Yanxing&amp;rsquo; directly, there will be different problems in different scenarios. The cmd under windows is fine, but it is garbled in a utf-8 parser, so the best way is to define a Chinese (or non-English) strings are defined in unicode, and then decoded and output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decode string to unicode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s = &amp;lsquo;Yang Yanxing&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s_uni = s.decode(&amp;lsquo;gbk&amp;rsquo;) #Convert s to unicode, and add the original encoding type of this character when decoding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s_utf8 = s_uni.encode(&amp;lsquo;utf-8&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s_gbk = s_uni.encode(&amp;lsquo;gbk&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>logging module application in python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a logging module that comes with the system in python, which is very convenient to use, and this module is often used in the program, so that if there is a problem, you can easily find where the problem is through the log, which is more convenient than directly looking for the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recorded some frequently used, not very commonly used ones, which can be viewed in the python documentation [http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html](

      <title>Windows automation testing using python (1)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started to learn to organize the use of python in windows automation testing. I think it is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea, under Windows, is to start the process, then find the handle of the process, and then operate the handle, including clicking, filling in text, closing, getting text, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a simple operation of verifying the md5 value of a file to introduce a python application. Of course, there is a function for verifying md5 in python. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use tools to verify it. Here is just an exercise to use python to automate operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools used are SpyLite, which is used to view window ID, handle and other information&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wanted to build a WeChat application for Xiaohuangji, but along the way, I found that many methods are no longer available. I tried it locally, and I also tried the method of getting the session through requests, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, but after this toss , but I have a better understanding of cookies. The following example uses python to log in to Renren.com to introduce the use of cookies.
The definition of cookie can refer to Baidu Encyclopedia, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://baike.baidu.com/subview/835/5062332.htm&#34; title=&#34;http://baike.baidu.com/subview/835/5062332.htm&#34; rel=&#34;noopener external nofollow noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34; exturl&#34;&gt;

    &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-external-link-alt&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; But it says inside Messy, and a lot of repetition, use tools such as firefox or fiddler to grab cookies
Using the httpFox plug-in under firefox to check the login of Renren.com, the POST address is [http://www.renren.com/ajaxLogin](
