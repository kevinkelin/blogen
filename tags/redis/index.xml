      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, when I stress tested an interface in the system, I found that there was a large number of errors reported in the redis query interface, so I checked the background log and found that aioredis reported &lt;code&gt;Too many connections&lt;/code&gt;. At first, I thought it was because of the stress test. , because this interface needs to access redis data, and a large number of requests come in at the same time, it will cause a large number of requests to the redis server, and the redis server can&amp;rsquo;t resist returning the &lt;code&gt;Too many connections&lt;/code&gt; error, but this is not the case after investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
